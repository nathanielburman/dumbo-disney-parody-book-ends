DumboDisney Proudly Presents A Presentation Presently Presented By Jumbo the Black Elephantess, in a land under the Kingdom.

In the dark kingdom the men search for women to save. French girls reading books has become a problem. They read and their thoughts create demons that attack the village men. Off With These DumboDisney Princesses Heads!

Other girls like Belle, French girls, exist in this realm, surrounded by thistles and spikes. Men cannot get to them through the bush. THey are isolated and solitary. They read all day.

A woman sits on the side of a fountain, reading a history book. Things flying out of her head in bubbles.

Its a romance book! Its not a science book!

No its a history book.

A man sees her reading from the distance.

He runs up saying, ILL SAVE YOU!

He takes his sword and strikes the book out of her hands.

The book flys up right towards his face with evil magic and knocks him down.

He strikes at the book as it tries to eat his face off.

He stabs the book until it stops moving and then swings back and removes the girl's head.

Men and woman sit in parties inside a bar and they are drinking and singing loudly, songs.

They are drunk and talking about the day.

A woman's head sits in the middle of the table.

Small little thought bubble still leaving her head.
